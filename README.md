- ⚡ Fun fact: The world's quietest room is located at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. It's an anechoic chamber designed to absorb almost all sound. In fact, it's so quiet that people who enter often report feeling a sense of pressure in their ears or even hallucinations!  This special room is used for testing products where sound quality is important.
